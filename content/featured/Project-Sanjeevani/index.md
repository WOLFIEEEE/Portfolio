Project Sanjeevani aims to develop a [Smart Oxygen Delivery System](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/crj/2019/4901049/#supplementary-materials) specifically designed for Covid-19 patients.It is a remarkable endeavor that I had the privilege to work on during my internship. As part of the team, I took on the responsibility of designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for small-sized screens such as [Nextion](https://nextion.tech/), ensuring usability and functionality. With careful consideration, I created intuitive interfaces that empower medical professionals to monitor and control the Smart Oxygen Delivery System effortlessly. Additionally, I skillfully integrated code within [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), leading to the development of a functional prototype that showcases the system's potential.

Curious to know how it all went? Why not discuss that in detail in an interview?
