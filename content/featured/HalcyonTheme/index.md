This is a visualization project that utilizes [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for authentication, and the [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to gather data about user repositories, followers, user details, and rate limits. The project uses [Fusion Charts](https://www.fusioncharts.com/) to create visualizations for the gathered data. Users can authenticate themselves through Auth0 and then view their [Github](https://github.com/WOLFIEEEE) data. The project can be deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for easy access.
