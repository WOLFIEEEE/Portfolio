Limha is a cutting-edge project that focuses on developing a fully automated predictive maintenance[Predictive Maintenance](https://www.fiixsoftware.com/maintenance-strategies/predictive-maintenance/) system for large machinery.It is a remarkable endeavor that I had the privilege to work on during my internship As part of the project, I personally developed a user-friendly real-time dashboard using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). This dashboard seamlessly integrates data from various sources, providing maintenance personnel with the necessary insights for effective decision-making ,to enhance overall efficiency and reliability, Limha incorporates advanced [anomaly detection](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/anomaly-detection) models that I trained and deployed on ARM architecture. These models analyze the machinery data in real-time, detecting any anomalies or potential issues.

Curious to know how it all went? Why not discuss that in detail in an interview?
